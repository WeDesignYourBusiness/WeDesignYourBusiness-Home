				<div class="panel-body">
					<h3>What is the difference between a <b>multi page website</b> and a <b>single page website</b>?</h3>
				 	<p>A multi page website has more than one page to view (i.e a home page, contact page, gallery) whereas a single page website has everything on one page where users can just scroll up and down to find whatever they want.</p>

					<h3>How do I know if I should buy the business package or the personal package?</h3>
					<p>Well thats simple. If your website is for profit then you are in the business category. But if your site is just for your own personal ventures such as job hunting or displaying your skills and talents then you are in the personal category.</p>

				<h3>When does my business have to pay?</h3>
		 		<p>All payments must be upfront. Payments can be made in cash or through PayPal.</p>

		 		<h3>What if we don't have the money at the time?</h3>
		 		<p>Then we can not do business with you until you have the money. We take businesses much more seriously than we do individual people.</p>

		 		<h3>Are there any fees?</h3>
		 		<p>Yes, there is a non-refundable fee of $50 once a business has signed up with us. We also offer in person service concerning web design, website deployment and logo design. The first visit is free but every visit after costs at least $15.</p>

		 		<h3>What are in person services and how much do the cost?</h3>
		 		<p>In person services are any services that require us to come and meet you. These services can range from meetings that involve us getting your site in order to teaching you how to maintain your site. Depending on how far you are from us and how tasking what you're asking us to do is we will charge you somewhere between 15 to 40 dollars?</p>

		 		<h3>Can I call or email you guys in order to get help?</h3>
		 		<p>Yes of course! But if what you need is urgent or too difficult to get done remotely then we can meet so as to get the work done.</p>
